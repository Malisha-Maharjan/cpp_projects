# Inheritance

### Defination:
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called **_Inheritance_**.

It is the process of creating new class from one or more existing class , the new class is called _derived class_ and exisiting class is called _base class_.




#### Types of Inheritance:
1. Single  Inheritance
2. Multiple Inheritance
3. Multi-level Inheritance
4. Hierarchical Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance
6. Multipath Inheritance
   
   
## Ambiguity:
In OOP ambiguity means duplication of members due to inheritance, In child class there will be 2 or more member with same name from inherited class.

### Virtual Base Class: 
To avoid ambiguity we can make the common base class as virtual base class.
### ContainerClass:
 Class consists of object of one class in another object.
