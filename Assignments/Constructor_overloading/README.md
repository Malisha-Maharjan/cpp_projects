## Constructor Overloading

Constructor overloding is same as the function overloading. As we can use same name of the function whose parameter sets are different, we can also use the same name of the constructor whose parameter sets are different. _If the class have more than one constructor it is called **constructor overloding**_.

Depending upon the number and the type of arguments passed, the corresponding constructor is called.

### Thinks To Remember:
1. Arguments should be passed when the object is created.
2. The name of all the constructors must be same but the data type or the number of arguments must be different.
3. The constructors must be defined within the same class.
